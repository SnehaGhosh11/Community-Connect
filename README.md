During my one-month internship at a hospital, I worked as a helper assisting patients with their needs and guiding them through various hospital procedures. Alongside this, I gained practical experience in maintaining hospital records and understanding how healthcare data is managed. I observed the use of database management systems for storing and retrieving patient information securely, ensuring accuracy and confidentiality. This experience gave me valuable insights into healthcare operations, data privacy, and the importance of efficient record-keeping in hospital management.
